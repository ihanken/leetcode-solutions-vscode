A storage of my leetcode solutions done through the [LeetCode VS Code extention](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shengchen.vscode-leetcode).


The extension doesn't have a great way to automatically section off problems, so all problems are just raw files named `<problemNumber>.<problemName>.<fileExtension>`. For example, problem 27 (Remove Element) is `27.remove-element.py`. Searching by number is probably easiest.
